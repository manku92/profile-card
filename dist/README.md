## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was more challenging then i thought. Which was the placement of the background circles using the position attribute. Took a couple of tries to get right but feel i still need alot of learning.

### Continued development

I need to focus on building mobile first. Using media queries.
